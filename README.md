Hardware Repository System (React App)This project contains a simulated hardware repository system built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS utility classes.PrerequisitesYou need Node.js (which includes npm or yarn) installed on your machine.Setup InstructionsCreate the project directory structure:mkdir hardware-repo-app
cd hardware-repo-app
mkdir src
Place the files:Place the content of package.json into a file named package.json in the root folder (hardware-repo-app).Place the content of index.html into a file named index.html in the root folder (hardware-repo-app).Place the content of src/main.jsx into a file named main.jsx inside the src folder.Place the content of src/RepositoryApp.jsx into a file named RepositoryApp.jsx inside the src folder.Install dependencies:Open your terminal in the root folder (hardware-repo-app) and run:npm install
(Note: This assumes a standard project setup like Vite or CRA where React and ReactDOM are the main dependencies, but you may need to adjust the dependencies if your local setup requires a specific bundler config.)Run the application:Run the start script (requires a bundler/dev server like Vite or similar):npm run dev
This command will typically start a development server (e.g., on http://localhost:5173), and you can view the application in your browser.
